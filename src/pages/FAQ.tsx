          answer: "Our courses combine video lessons, interactive exercises, and live sessions. After enrolling, you'll receive access to our learning platform where all materials are organized into modules. You can proceed at your own pace, but we recommend following the suggested timeline. Each module builds on the previous one, creating a comprehensive learning journey."

We recommend starting with our orientation module to familiarize yourself with all resources available."
